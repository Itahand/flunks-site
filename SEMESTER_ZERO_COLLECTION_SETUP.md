# How to Enable Your Semester Zero NFT Collection

To receive **Flunks: Semester Zero NFTs**, you need to initialize your collection first. This is a one-time setup that allows your wallet to receive and store NFTs from the SemesterZero contract.

## Option 1: In-Game Setup (Recommended)

1. **Visit Paradise Motel in-game**
2. Click the **"Lobby"** button
3. At the bottom of the lobby, you'll see a green button that says **"🎫 Set up Collection"** or **"✅ Collection ready!"**
4. Click the setup button and sign the transaction with your wallet
5. That's it! You're ready to receive NFTs!

## Option 2: Flowty Marketplace

1. Visit [Flowty.io](https://flowty.io/)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Navigate to the Flunks: Semester Zero collection
4. Click **"Enable Collection"**
5. Sign the transaction

## What Happens Next?

Once your collection is set up:
- ✅ You can receive Chapter 5 NFTs automatically when you complete objectives
- ✅ Your NFTs will appear in your wallet and on Flowty
- ✅ You only need to do this setup **once per wallet**

## Troubleshooting

**"Collection ready!" already showing?**
- You're all set! No need to do anything else.

**Setup button not appearing?**
- Make sure your wallet is connected
- Try refreshing the page

**Transaction failed?**
- Ensure you have enough FLOW for gas fees (usually very small, < 0.001 FLOW)
- Check that your wallet is connected to **mainnet** (not testnet)
