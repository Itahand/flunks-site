CAFETERIA IMAGE UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS
====================================

To complete the cafeteria enhancement for Week 1 of Semester Zero:

1. Upload your cafeteria image as: cafeteria.png
2. Place it in this exact location: /public/images/locations/cafeteria.png
3. Recommended image dimensions: 1920x1080 or similar wide aspect ratio
4. Image should show an interior view of a high school cafeteria

The image will be displayed as a full background in the cafeteria pop-up window, which now opens at the same large size (70vw x 70vh) as the Geeks House, Freaks House, and Arcade windows.

Current file path expected by the code:
/public/images/locations/cafeteria.png

If the image fails to load, it will fallback to a blank image automatically.
